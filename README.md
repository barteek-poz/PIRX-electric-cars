<h1>PIRX</h1>

**PIRX** is a fictional project of a company manufacturing electric cars, which can be viewed at the following link: https://pirx-electric-cars.netlify.app/. The website was built using React and Vite, while car and showroom data are fetched from a Firebase database. React Hook Form and react-select were utilized for input and select validation. The site is fully responsive. The design of the page draws strong inspiration from the dieCar project (https://dribbble.com/shots/21228185-dieCar-Shop-Page), while the copyright and logic of the site were developed independently.
